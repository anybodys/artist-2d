# Artist 2D

This is a project for fun that's loosely based on what's probably a totally incorrect interpretation
of a genetic algorithm. Eventually.

This code:
* Programmatically generates abstract art based on input "DNA" files.
* [TODO] Other things like dislays the output for voting, allows voting, mixes the DNA files of vote winners for a new generation, generates the next generation's images, and other such fun behaviors.

## Getting Started

TODO: Instructions for pipenv.

TODO: Set up precommit hooks.

## Run

```
make run
```

This generate and an image to a path I find convenient because I haven't made it a variable yet.

## Test

```
make test
```

TODO: CI

## Deploy

Nothing to deploy yet. :)
